# Mediffusion

Actively being documented. Please check back soon.

## Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Create a Conda Environment

If you haven't installed Conda yet, you can download it from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). After installing, create a new Conda environment by running:

```bash
conda create --name mediffusion python=3.10
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate mediffusion
```

### Step 2: Install PyTorch

Install PyTorch specifically for CUDA 11.8 by running:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Step 3: Install The Package

You can install the latest version from github using:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BardiaKh/Mediffusion.git -u
```

This will install all the necessary packages.

## Training 
### 1. Hyperparameters
Before starting the training, it is recommended that you set up some global constants and environment variables:

```python
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0,1"
os.environ['WANDB_API_KEY'] = "WANDB-API-KEY"

TOTAL_IMAGE_SEEN = 40e6
BATCH_SIZE = 36
NUM_DEVICES = 2 # number of devices in CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
TRAIN_ITERATIONS = int(TOTAL_IMAGE_SEEN / (BATCH_SIZE * NUM_DEVICES))
```

### 2. Preparing Data

To prepare the data, you need to create a dataset where each element is a dictionary. The dictionary should have the key "img" and may also contain additional keys like "cls" and "concat" depending on the type of condition. One way to do this is by using MONAI. Below is a sample code snippet:

```python
import monai as mn

train_data_dicts = [
    {"img": "./image1.dcm", "cls": 2},
    {"img": "./image2.dcm", "cls": 0}
]

valid_data_dicts = [
    {"img": "./image9.dcm", "cls": 1}
]

transforms = mn.transforms.Compose([
    mn.transforms.LoadImageD(keys="img"),
    mn.transforms.SelectItemsD(keys=["img","cls"]),
    mn.transforms.ToTensorD(keys=["img","cls"], dtype=torch.float, track_meta=False),
])

train_ds = Dataset(data=train_data_dicts, transform=transforms) 
valid_ds = Dataset(data=valid_data_dicts, transform=transforms)
train_sampler = torch.utils.data.RandomSampler(train_ds, replacement=True, num_samples=TOTAL_IMAGE_SEEN)
```

At the end of this step, you should have `train_ds`, `val_ds` and `train_sampler`.

For sample configurations, please checkout the `sample_configs` directory.

**Note**: If a field is left out of the config file, the default value is infered based on this file: `mediffusion/default_config/default.yaml`.

#### Instantiating Model

You can instantiate the model using the configuration file and dataset as follows:

```python
from mediffusion import DiffusionModule

model = DiffusionModule(
    "./config.yaml",
    train_ds=train_ds,
    val_ds=valid_ds,
    dl_workers=2,
    train_sampler=train_sampler,
    batch_size=32,               # train batch size
    val_batch_size=16            # validation batch size (recommended size is half of batch_size)
)
```

### 4. Setting Up Trainer
You can set up the trainer using the `Trainer` class:

```python
from mediffusion import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    max_steps=TRAIN_ITERATIONS,
    val_check_interval=5000,
    root_directory="./outputs", # where to save the weights and logs
    precision="16-mixed",       # mixed precision training
    devices=-1,                 # use all the devices in CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
    nodes=1,
    wandb_project="Your_Project_Name",
    logger_instance="Your_Logger_Instance",
)
```

### 5. Training the Model

Finally, to train your model, you simply call:

```python
trainer.fit(model)
```

## Prediction 
### 1. Loading the Model

First, import the `DiffusionModule` class and load the pre-trained model checkpoint. The model is then moved to the CUDA device and set to inference mode. Additionally, you may choose to enable half-precision for better performance:

```python
from mediffusion import DiffusionModule

model = DiffusionModule("path/to/classifier_free_2d.yaml")
model.load_ckpt("path/to/last_saved_checkpoint.cktp", ema=True)
model.cuda().half()
model.eval()
```

### 2. Preparing Input

Prepare the noise and model keyword arguments. Here, `"cls"` specifies the class condition and is set to 0:

```python
import torch

noise = torch.randn(1, 1, 256, 256)
model_kwargs = {"cls": torch.tensor([0]).cuda().half()}
```

**Note**: You can use other keys like `concat` and/or `cls_embed`. To find out more, look at the `tutorials` directory.

### 3. Making Predictions

To make a prediction, use the `predict` method from the `DiffusionModule` class:

```python
img = model.predict(
    noise, 
    model_kwargs=model_kwargs, 
    classifier_cond_scale=4, 
    inference_protocol="DDIM100"
)
```

- `noise`: The input noise tensor
- `model_kwargs`: A dictionary containing additional model configurations (e.g., class conditions)
- `classifier_cond_scale`: The scale used for the classifier free guidance condition during inference
- `inference_protocol`: The inference protocol to be used (e.g., `"DDIM100"`)

The `img` is the generated output based on the model's inference (`C:H:W(:D)`). To save the image, you need to transpose it first, due to the different axis conventions.

**Note**: The model currently supports the following solvers: `DDPM`,`DDIM`,`IDDIM`(for inverse diffusion), and `PNMD`. As an example, `"PNMD100"` means using the `PNMD` solver for `100` steps.
